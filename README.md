# Description

This is my first little project I worked on to practice class inheritance in JavaScript. There is a parent class Parallelepiped and a child class Cube. Theu represent the corresponding geometrical objects using the third class: Vector, representing a geometrical vector (or a point in 3D space). This classes have methods that allow to add and scale vectors and calculate dot/cross product. The Parallelepiped class has methods of calculating the surface area and volume.

# What I learned

- Basic class syntax in JavaScript
- Class inheritance
